What the project does:
Uses Machine Learning to (1) convert American Sign Language to text and (2) convert real time live-stream speech to text.

Why the project is useful:
American Sign Language users can use our ASL-to-text platform as a means of learning, getting instant feedback on signed word arrangements, and as a means of expression to communicate with non-ASL users. Our video call-based speech-to-text converter also hosts transcribing capabilities not yet offered on popular platforms like WhatsApp, Line, and Discord. Heightened by COVID-19, those who are hard of hearing might have difficulty lip-reading or be unable to reproduce real life conversations over online platforms due to a host of reasons. We hope our web app can circumvent that.
